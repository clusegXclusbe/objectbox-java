Nexus 2 is a popular and versatile virtual synthesizer that can produce a wide range of sounds, from lush pads and arpeggios to dance leads and basses. Nexus 2 is a ROMpler, which means it uses ready-made sounds that are stored in its library. You can tweak these sounds using various effects and modulation options, but you cannot create your own sounds from scratch or import your own samples.
