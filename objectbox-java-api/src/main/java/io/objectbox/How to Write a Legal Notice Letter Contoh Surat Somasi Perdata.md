However, you can follow some general guidelines and use some examples to help you craft a clear and effective letter. Here are some steps and tips on how to write a legal notice letter:
 
1. **Identify the parties involved**. You should state your name and address as the sender of the letter, and the name and address of the person or entity you are sending the letter to. You should also mention your relationship with the recipient, such as creditor, debtor, landlord, tenant, employer, employee, etc.
2. **State the reason for the letter**. You should explain the nature and details of the dispute or problem that led you to send the letter. You should provide relevant facts and evidence to support your claim or demand. For example, you can attach copies of contracts, invoices, receipts, emails, or other documents that prove your case.
3. **Specify your demands or requests**. You should clearly state what you want the recipient to do or not do to resolve the issue.

4. **Warn of the consequences of non-compliance**. You should inform the recipient of the legal actions you will take if they fail to meet your demands or requests within the deadline. You should also mention any damages or losses you have suffered or will suffer as a result of their non-compliance. For example, you can state that you will file a lawsuit, report them to authorities, terminate a contract, or seek compensation.
5. **Sign and date the letter**. You should sign your name at the end of the letter and write the date you sent it. You should also keep a copy of the letter for your records.

To:
 Mr. Tono Sumartono
 Address
 
Dear Mr. Sumartono,
 
I am writing this letter as a creditor of yours who lent you Rp 50 million on 1 October 2022. As per our agreement, you were supposed to repay me in full by 31 October 2022. However, until now, you have not paid me back any amount of money.
 
This is a clear breach of contract on your part and has caused me financial hardship and distress. I have tried to contact you several times by phone and email but you have ignored my calls and messages.
 
Therefore, through this letter, I hereby demand that you pay me back Rp 50 million plus interest at 10% per month within 7 days from the date of this letter. If you fail to do so, I will have no choice but to take legal action against you in court. I will also claim damages for breach of contract and interest.
 
I hope that you will take this matter seriously and settle your debt as soon as possible. Please contact me at 08123456789 or email@example.com to confirm your payment.
 
Sincerely,
 Your signature
 Your name
