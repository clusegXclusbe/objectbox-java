In this article, we will show you how to create a simple report with Rave Reports 11 using the visual report designer. We will use a sample database that comes with Delphi and C++Builder, called DBDemos. The report will display some information about customers and their orders.

1. Open Delphi or C++Builder and create a new VCL Forms Application.
2. Save the project and the main form as RaveDemo.dpr and RaveDemoForm.pas respectively.
3. On the main form, add a TButton component and set its Caption property to "Show Report".
4. Double-click on the button to create an OnClick event handler. Leave it empty for now.
5. Go to File > New > Other and select Rave Reports from the dialog box. Choose Rave Project and click OK.
6. A new window will open with the Rave Visual Report Designer. Save the project as RaveDemo.rav.
7. In the Project Tree panel, right-click on Data Objects and select New Data Object. Choose Direct Data View and click OK.
8. A new data object will appear in the Project Tree panel. Rename it as CustomerData.
9. In the Object Inspector panel, set the Connection property to DBDemosConnection. This is a predefined connection that points to the DBDemos database.
10. Set the SQL property to "select \* from customer". This is the query that will retrieve the data from the customer table.
11. Right-click on CustomerData and select Preview Data. You should see a grid with the data from the customer table.
12. Close the preview window and repeat steps 7 to 11 to create another data object called OrderData. Set its Connection property to DBDemosConnection and its SQL property to "select \* from orders". Preview the data to make sure it is correct.
13. In the Project Tree panel, right-click on Reports and select New Report. A new report will appear in the designer area. Rename it as CustomerReport.
14. In the Object Inspector panel, set the PageWidth property to 8.5 and the PageHeight property to 11. This will set the report size to letter format.
15. Drag a TRvSystem component from the Rave tab of the Component Palette and drop it on the main form. This component is used to link a report project with a Delphi or C++Builder application.
16. In the Object Inspector panel, set the SystemPrinter property to True. This will enable printing to a physical printer.
17. Set the ExecuteMethod property to emModalPreview. This will show a preview window when the report is executed.
18. Set the ProjectFile property to RaveDemo.rav. This is the name of the report project file that we created earlier.
19. Set the DefaultDest property to rdFile. This will save the report output to a file instead of printing it directly.
20. Set the OutputFileName property to CustomerReport.pdf. This is the name of the file where the report output will be saved.
